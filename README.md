# TradingStrategy

- The goal is this project is to select short and long moving averages that a financial operator would use to advertise on buying/selling stock or to invest using a short/long strategy.

- Although EMA is optimal for short term trades, SMA become more reliable by confirming trends for mid - longer positions

- Percentage gains/ losses are calculated by subtracting the most recent Buy price from Sell price
